Source Code Rules

For anyone interested in repacking please read all this

1st I heavily discourage Repacking/Building from my source code, as it would greatly impact your ability to receive feature updates and bug fixes

2nd I will not support any repacks if its is causing conflict that I can't reproduce with the my published mod

3rd YOU MUST PROVIDE CREDIT on the steam page and you must link to the Orginal Mod or the Source Code
